Week 1 exercises: Only used AI when I was finished to check if I was correct

Week 2 exercises: Asked a couple of questions about problem 30 regarding the menu, but then figured it out. 

Week 3 exercises: I asked AI to check what I was printing and if it was necessary or not after I completed my code.
